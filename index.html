			<li>Wilton Norman Chamberlain (August 21, 1936 â€“ October 12, 1999) was an American professional basketball player who played as a center. Standing at 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m) tall,[2] he played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for 14 years and is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the sport's history. Several publications have argued that Chamberlain is the greatest NBA player of all time. He holds numerous NBA regular season records in scoring, rebounding, and durability categories; most notably he is the only player to score 100 points in a single NBA game, and average more than 40 and 50 points in a season.</li>
